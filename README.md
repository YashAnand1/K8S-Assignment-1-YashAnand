# **Overview** 
</div>

In order to help gauge the understanding of the participants of the topics discussed in the first session on **`Kubernetes`**, we were assigned a total of 6 Tasks by Harsh Sir. The tasks assigned are mainly from the [Red Hat course of DO188](https://rol.redhat.com/rol/app/courses/do188-4.12/pages/pr01), which has been titled as **`Red Hat OpenShift Development I`**. Though the title of this course does not contain `Kuberenetes` in it, we can still understand its basics since OpenShift uses Kuberenetes underneath. 

During our first session, the chapters that we were able to cover as well as the chapters based on which we were assigned the tasks, were as follows:
-  Chapter 1: Introduction and Overview of Containers
-  Chapter 2: Podman Basics
-  Chapter 3: Container Images

Through the means of this document, I will be providing answers and solutions to the assigned tasks, which are as follows:
- Learning Encoding & Encryption
- Differentiating Tunnels & Bridges
- Understanding System Booting
- Modifying Podman's Data Directory
- Performing DO188 Guided Excercises

Since the main objective of the first three chapters was to help the participants get a better understanding of Podman, I greatly utilised this tutorial by Tech Primers before getting started with executing the tasks.

In the following sections, I have documented, demonstrated and explained how I was able to complete the assigned tasks that have been mentioned above, while using [Red Hat's DO188 Course](https://rol.redhat.com/rol/app/courses/do188-4.12/pages/pr01) as my main resource and guide. However, before being able to get started with the tasks, it was very much important to fulfill some prerequisites, which have been discussed in the next section.
